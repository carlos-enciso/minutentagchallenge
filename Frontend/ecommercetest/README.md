# Minutentag FrontEnd Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a sample project for a potential e commerce application that sells products with different SKUs for each product type.

There is a landing page `/products` with the list of all the products and a details page `/product/<id>-<productname>` with the specifics of each product.

### **!!!! Make sure to run the Backend Project First and it is pointing to http://localhost:4000/ !!!!**

## Installation

- Download the code using your preffered method (zip, github desktop, etc)
- Open a terminal and navigate to the downloaded code
- Simply run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- After installation run `npm start` and wait until the console shows the message `You can now view ecommercetest in the browser. `

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
